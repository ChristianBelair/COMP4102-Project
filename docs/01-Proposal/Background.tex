\section{Background}
\subsection{Gaze detection and Tracking}

Gaze detection and tracking has many positive implications for driver safety, namely to detect if a driver is distracted or drowsy. The US department of transportation found that in years 2011-2015 an overall $2.5\%$ of fatalities were caused by drowsy driving~\cite{CrashDrowsy}, and for distracted driving in 2018 it was found that $8\%$ of fatalities were distraction-affected~\cite{CrashDistracted}. Currently there are a wide variety of well-established and novel techniques for gaze tracking as found by a survey by Chennamma and Xiaohui~\cite{chennamma2013survey}.
