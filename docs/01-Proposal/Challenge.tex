\section{The Challenge}

This space has a number of challenges. 
While any one component of this project has many implementations even within the computer vision space, making them all work together in real time on mid to low end hardware.
In addition, gaze tracking with a single camera is a more difficult area with no simple, of-the-shelf implementation in openCV.
