\section{Goals and Deliverables}

\subsection{Primary Goals}

The primary goals for this project is to create a suite of car safety features which are solved using computer vision.
The three main safety features involves gaze tracking, road sign and traffic light detection, and pedestrian detection.
Each play a role in distracted driving incidents where a driver's gaze might not be focused on a pedestrian, road signs, or traffic lights when a driver should be.

\subsection{Evaluation}

\subsection{Stretch Goals}

The primary stretch goal for us to add an interaction between the modules.
As a proof of concept, we would implement a system to ensure a driver has actually looked in the direction of a pedestrian or sign.
An additional goal would be to validate it running on a Raspberry Pi Zero as a proof it can be embedded into an actually.
