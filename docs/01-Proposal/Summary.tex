\section{Summary}

The goal of this project is to create a car safety suite using computer vision.
The initial targets are to create a system that tracks pedestrians, road signs, and stop lights as well as tracking the driver's attentiveness to the road.
A secondary goal is to make the system highly modular, so new components can be easily added in or create interactions between modules.
