\section{Summary}

The goal of this project is to create an automotive safety suite using computer vision.
Our goals are to create a suite of services to track pedestrians, road signs and stop lights, as well as tracking the driver's eye movements to detect distracted driving.
%The initial targets are to create a system that tracks pedestrians, road signs, and stop lights as well as tracking the driver's attentiveness to the road.
A secondary goal is to make the system highly modular, so new components can be easily added in or create interactions between modules.
