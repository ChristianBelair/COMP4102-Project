\section*{Abstract}

The Automotive Safety Suite (abbreviated ASS) is a collection of safety features which try to solve distracted driving problems using computer vision. This project aims to combine Gaze Tracking, Pedestrian Tracking, and Road Sign Tracking to create a comprehensive safety suite that can detect a drivers attentiveness to hazards around them. These hazards can then be reported on to a vehicle safety system, or to warn the driver of any signs or pedestrians that may not have been noticed.
