\section{Introduction}

The Automotive Safety Suite (ASS) is a collection of safety features which try to solve distracted driving problems using computer vision. The ASS has three main components: Gaze Tracking, Pedestrian Tracking, and Road Sign Tracking. Gaze tracking determines where eyes exist in the driver's camera view and derives gaze in order to determine where it is the driver is looking. Pedestrian Tracking involves trying to identify pedestrains in the application's road view. This component is meant to identify where within the view pedestrians are if they exist. The last component is Road Sign Tracking where using the same road view as Pedestrian Tracking it detects and identifies where within the video frame road signs are if they exist. The main goal is to have a suite of features that work together to avoid distracted driving by notifying the driver whenever their gaze is not within an acceptable range of oncoming road signs or pedestrians.
